                            <h2 class="titlecol"> The Housing Movement and its Leaders </h2>
                            <p> “The right to housing is the door to the rest of the rights” was a sentiment expressed by every leader of the housing coalition that I interviewed (personal communication, 2016). During my case study, I interviewed Donizete of União Movimento de Moradia western region, Izilda of Associacão Dos Sem Terra Da Zona Norte, and Graca of Movimento de Moradia da Região sudeste União dos Movimentos de Moradia. All of these leaders were “roofless” at one point in their life and through their involvement with the housing movement, not only did they gain a physical structure to call home, but an education, career, and an ability to claim their rights to citizenship through legal measures. Earl would categorize these leaders as “transgressive” citizens—they go beyond the limits of what is “morally, socially, or legally acceptable” (Earl, 2012). However, through my interviews not only is the housing movement transgressive, but it is a threat to the exclusionary practices of Sao Paulo’s contemporary definition of democracy by using the housing as a way to construct their way to the right to the city. </p>

                            <p> The housing movement calls into question the way in which government benefits, services, and taxes are distributed throughout the city of Sao Paulo and pressures the government to redistribute the aforementioned resources. During my interview with Graca, she spoke of the financial relationship between construction companies and government officials, where the government will grant construction the right to build social housing for the urban poor and in return, the construction company would donate money to the politician’s campaign. Awareness of this relationship allows the housing movement to negotiate the type of housing people want and (or) need, because they are able to use this evidence to explain to the government why the housing movement should be in charge of building their own housing. According to Graca, when the government just builds social housing and gives people to the keys to their new home, many people end up giving up their house. Also, housing built by the construction companies are likely to be built on the periphery of the city which reinforces the spatial separation between the rich and working poor in Sao Paulo. Thus, when the government directly gives money to the movement and allow people to build their own housing, “challenge the spatial segregation of the city by calling for centrally located social housing and opposing the practice of building social housing on the extreme peripheries, contributing to the city’s sprawl” (Earl, 2012). As a result, when the housing movement is victorious in their negotiations with the government, they gain the will to demand more infrastructure and rights to the city such as public transportation, roads, water and sewage, and electricity.</p>

                            <h2 class="titlecol">The Brazilian Constitution and The Right to Housing  </h2>
                            <p> The demand for housing is fought within the legal realms under the 1988 constitution of Brazil. The housing movement noticed that the inscribed laws of the right of housing and the social functions of property were not being performed. Thus, when the movement attempts to make the inscribed and performed governance converge, they establish “a new type of relationship between the state and society, one in which the state is held as the lawbreaker and transgressor, while by contrast, social movements of the urban poor are implementing the law by giving social function to property and implementing the right to housing” (Earl, 2012). Earl further argues that the ambiguity of the movement’s tactic when it comes to legality and illegality of occupations brings recognition and acknowledgement of the housing problem as well as the lack of other rights to the city (2012). If the housing movement were to ask the government for housing, they probably would not get adequate housing as mentioned earlier, it would take a long time to get housing because of the bureaucracy within the government, and it would not create the tensions or tug-a-war (where the rope is the government) between property owners the government, and the housing movement like occupations create. Therefore, it becomes important for members of the housing movement to understand and negotiate the law so that they have the agency to fight for all of their rights in order to gain full citizenship.  </p>

                            <p> Legalizing their status through infrastructure, paying taxes, and entitlement to land gives members of the housing movement to develop themselves and break the cycle of poverty. According to Holston, in order to be a citizen in a democracy, one must consume, construct, and pay taxes (Earl, 2012). Donizete echoed this when he said that people in Brazil are “free to participate in a democracy, but they are not truly free until they have money and the ability to consume. In constructing their way to the city, the housing movement still operates within the construction of society as it stands through the mandatory participation required by the movement in order to gain housing, the gender relations within the movement, and the supply and demand relationship in the movement where some people have housing and some do not. The question remains is how do you redefine citizenship and the right to city without the influence of one’s past, current positonality, and the society in which they live? Is the end goal to gain access to citizenship or to redefine citizenship? </p>
